#Kraken

A toolkit for web development, with a penchant for mobile-related tech.

Still murky, but one idea is to create templates that use various libraries, then reverse-engineer them to be auto-generatable. We'll have to keep versioning in mind though.

##Templates

- bootstrap-iscroll: Uses Bootstrap and iScroll to create a responsive UX

##Generator

See [/generator/README.md](https://github.com/upstart/Kraken/blob/master/generator/README.md) for more info.
